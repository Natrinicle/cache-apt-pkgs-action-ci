# cache-apt-pkgs-action-ci

Continuous integration repository for the GitHub action [``awalsh128/cache-apt-pkgs-action``](https://github.com/awalsh128/cache-apt-pkgs-action). This repository's GitHub action tests from the [staging branch](https://github.com/awalsh128/cache-apt-pkgs-action/tree/staging) so that all new changes are vetted before going into [master](https://github.com/awalsh128/cache-apt-pkgs-action/tree/master).

See the action [README.md](https://github.com/awalsh128/cache-apt-pkgs-action/README.md) for more information.

NOTE: To setup something like this for your own Github Actions. [Check out my blog post.](https://awalsh128.com/automated-testing-for-github-actions/)
